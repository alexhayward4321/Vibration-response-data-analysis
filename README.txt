This is just a repository with an example of data analysis from one of my mechanical engineering labs.

Data analysis is only taught in the imperial college MechEng course in excel, so the data analysis I was able to perform here primarily 
came off the back of my own effort to learn pandas and through getting familiar with python from taking online courses, nor did my
course ask me to learn git so that is self-taught too.

The data being analysed is from two experiments, both of which measured the acceleration of a metal mass placed on a steel beam that is
displaced to induce osicllation. In the first experiment, a student displaced the metal mass and allowed it to freely decay. In the
second, the mass was displaced by a force transducer and the steady state forced vibration response was measured. 

The data analysis is in the only python file in the repository: Data_analysis.py.
