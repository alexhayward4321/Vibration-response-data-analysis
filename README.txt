This is just a repository with an example of data analysis from one of my mechanical engineering labs.

Data analysis is only taught in the imperial college MechEng course in excel so I independently did my data analysis in python.

The data being analysed is from two experiments, both of which measured the acceleration of a metal mass placed on a steel beam that is
displaced to induce osicllation. In the first experiment, a student displaced the metal mass and allowed it to freely decay. In the
second, the mass was displaced by a force transducer and the steady state forced vibration response was measured. 

The data analysis is in the only python file in the repository: Data_analysis.py.
